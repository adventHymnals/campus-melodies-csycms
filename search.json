    "text": "What is contained in Advent Hymnals?\nThis is an ambitious project, already spanning more than a year. At the end of it, it should be able to achieve the following:\n\nText for all the songs in all hymnals used by Adventist from Millenial Harp of 1843 all the way to the present one.\nTunes for all of these hymns.\nLinks to renditions of these songs if they exist, or to those sang by singing software if human renditions of the same are not available.\nIdentify and make visible all points where there is an error in any of the songs, such as in Millenial Harp where it says of the second advent Gabriel sounds his mighty trumpet. This is part of singing with understanding.\nIdentify all changes that have been introduced in the modern hymnals and the reasons behind those changes.\nAvail all this data in an easy to use mobile phone application.\nAvail also a desktop application for personal use or for projecting in public worship."

Maybe you belong to one of those churches where most people know but a few songs and they never ever want to learn any new one, so that it is the same rounds meeting after meeting. But remember that in your family worship you can sing these. We will continue doing all that we can so as to make learning the songs here so easy that a child uneducated in music can learn them on his own.\nAs you continue singing, you will learn such deep Bible truths that can never be effaced."

A FEW MORE YEARS SHALL ROLL\n_1 A few more years shall roll, A few more seasons come, And we shall be with those that rest Asleep within the tomb: Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; O wash me in thy precious blood, And take my sins away.\n_2 A few more storms shall beat On this wild rocky shore, And we shall be where tempests cease, And surges swell no more: Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; (&c) O wash me in thy precious blood, And take my sins away. (&c)\n_3 A few more struggle here, A few more partings sore, A few more tears, a few more toils, And we shall weep no more: Then, O my Lord, prepare My soul for that great day; (&c) O wash me in thy precious blood, And take my sins away.(&c)\n\n\n2.

Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be? Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!\n_4 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless; Ills have no weight,and tears no bitterness: Where is death’s sting? where, grave, thy victory? I triumph still if Thou abide with me!\n\n\n\n3. ALL HAIL THE POWER OF JESUS’ NAME\n\nAuthor: Edward Perronet\n_1 All hail the power of Jesus’ name!

(&c_l)\n_2 All the way my Savior leads me; Cheers each winding path I tread; Gives me grace for every trial, Feeds me with the living bread; Though my weary steps may falter, And my soul athirst may be, Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see; Gushing from the Rock before me, Lo, a spring of joy I see. (&c_l)\n_3 All the way my Savior leads me; O the fullness of His love! Perfect rest to me is promised In my Father’s house above; When I wake to life immortal, Wing my flight to realms of day, This my song thro’ endless ages Jesus led me all the way; This my song thro’ endless ages (&c_l) Jesus led me all the way.
